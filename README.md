# Abstract-Data-Types

This repository contains the implementation of the following ADTs:

- ADTBList using Doubly Linked List
- ADTPriorityQueue using ADTSet, as well as using Heap
- ADTMap using Hash Tables
- ADTGraph using Adjacency Lists

A static library of the modules used to implement the ADTs is also included, in order to allow a further use.

The implementation of these ADTs was made during the second project of the Course "Data Structures" by DIT, UoA.
